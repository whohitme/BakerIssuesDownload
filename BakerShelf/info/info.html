  <h4>Digital Magazine</h4>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Oregon’s Agricultural Progress magazine is a report to the taxpayers of Oregon from Oregon State University’s Agricultural Experiment Station. Our stories, and the photography and design that help tell those stories, show how agriculture contributes to the economy, environment, and social structure of Oregon and the world. Our goal is to capture the interest of people who might otherwise think they have no connection to agricultural research.
